Symfony developers today face a choice: stick with **Webpack Encore**, adopt the new **AssetMapper**, or explore other alternatives...

I'm often asked about the current state of Webpack Encore in the Symfony ecosystem, its relevance, and what the future holds.
Is still a viable option? What about AssetMapper? Is there better alternative?

This article reviews where we are today, compares the options, and looks ahead.

## What's Webpack Encore?

[Webpack Encore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@symfony/webpack-encore) is a simple way to integrate webpack into your
Symfony application. It was formerly the default asset management tool in Symfony applications, allowing developers
to manage and compile their frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) easily.

Webpack Encore was created by [Ryan Weaver](https://github.com/weaverryan) (‚ù§Ô∏è) in March 2017 and has been the default
asset management tool in Symfony for many years. It allows developers to use modern JavaScript features and libraries,
such as ES6 modules, optimized chunks, React, Vue.js, and more.

Many years later, Webpack Encore is still maintained and updated, but its popularity has declined with the introduction
of [Symfony AssetMapper](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/asset_mapper.html), and the rise of more modern and
faster tools like [Vite](https://vite.dev/) (or [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/), etc...).

## Symfony AssetMapper

Since Symfony 6.3, a new component called [AssetMapper](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/asset_mapper.html) has
been introduced.

It's the new recommended way to manage frontend assets in Symfony applications, without the need for Node.js or a
bundler like Webpack Encore. Thanks to browsers' native support for ES modules and import maps, AssetMapper allows
you to use modern JavaScript features and libraries directly in the browser.

The Symfony AssetMapper is a great alternative to Webpack Encore for small to medium-sized projects that don't require
complex asset management.

Personally, as a Node.js and bundlers enthusiast, I often prefer using a full Node.js toolchain
(with code quality & testing tools) and Webpack Encore for my projects, except for very small projects that I don't
really care about and where AssetMapper is perfectly fine.

## The rise of Vite

Vite is a modern frontend build tool that has gained popularity in recent years due to its speed and simplicity.
It offers a much faster development experience compared to traditional bundlers based on webpack,
thanks to its use of native ES modules and on-demand file serving.

Recently, on July 27, 2025, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) overtook Webpack as the most
downloaded JavaScript bundler on npm ([npmtrends.com/vite-vs-webpack](https://npmtrends.com/vite-vs-webpack)).

Vite was already very fast and efficient, and it will soon integrate [Rolldown](http://rolldown.rs/), a Rust-based
bundler, which will make it even **faster**.

Vite can easily be integrated into Symfony applications using the [lhapaipai's Vite Bundle](https://github.com/lhapaipai/vite-bundle).

## Quick Comparison

Here's a quick comparison of Webpack Encore, Symfony AssetMapper, and Vite:

| Feature               | Webpack Encore               | AssetMapper           | Vite              |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------|:----------------------|:------------------|
| **Setup complexity**  | Medium                       | Very low              | Medium            |
| **Performance**       | Good                         | Very good             | Excellent         |
| **Ecosystem**         | Huge and stable              | Symfony-only          | Huge & growing    |
| **Best for**          | Legacy/complex projects      | Small/medium projects | Modern projects   |
| **Symfony status**    | Legacy, but still maintained | Recommended default   | Community bundle  |

## The future of Webpack Encore

With the rise of Symfony AssetMapper and Vite, the future of Webpack Encore may be uncertain.

While it is still maintained and updated (especially Webpack & loaders upgrades), webpack itself is becoming less
popular and relevant in the frontend ecosystem:
- webpack's complexity and configuration can be overwhelming
- Vite's API and speed are more appealing to developers looking for a modern and efficient build tool
- The community around Vite is growing rapidly, with many plugins and integrations being developed

In February 2024, I opened [a discussion about Webpack Encore's future](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/59707)
suggesting that Webpack Encore should be deprecated in favor of Vite, and make [lhapaipai's Vite Bundle](https://github.com/lhapaipai/vite-bundle)
the _official_ alternative to Webpack Encore, under the Symfony organization.

Things didn't move much since then, but I believe that in the next few years, Webpack Encore will be gradually phased out
in favor of more modern and efficient tools like Vite.

## Conclusion

1. **Webpack Encore** is still a **viable option** for asset management in Symfony applications, especially for **legacy and complex projects**
2. **Symfony AssetMapper** is a **great alternative for small to medium-sized projects** that don't require complex asset management
3. **Vite** is a modern and efficient build tool that is gaining popularity in the frontend ecosystem, and can be easily
   integrated into Symfony applications through **community bundles**

The future of Webpack Encore is a bit uncertain, but it is still maintained and updated for now.
As the frontend ecosystem continues to evolve, developers should consider their project requirements and choose the
most suitable tool for their needs.

In the future, Webpack Encore might internally use [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/) to stay relevant and fast‚Ä¶ who knows! üëÄ

Stay tuned! üöÄ
